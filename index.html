          <li>Programming languages that I have used in the school.</li>
        </ul>
        <img id="img2" src="IMG/Langu.jpg" alt="C/C++">
        <p>In my life I've used some programming languages in the school. The first programming language that I used was ASP.NET in Visual Studio 2012.
        I used that language because I was learning about desktop apps. Then I learned to use PHP and MySQL, and in this case I learned that language and data base because my teacher
        wanted us to learn about web programming. MySQL was my first database platform that I used.</p>
        <p>When I entered to the University, our teacher teached us C and C++.</p>
        <p>In the present, I'm learning Java in the school and I'm learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS on my own.</p>

        <p>I'm taking a course of Front-end developer and I'm learning HTML5, CSS with Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript with its features (react, DOM, JQuery).
          Also I'm learning Back-end developer and the languages programming that I use in this course is Node.js, Express.js and EJS.</p>
        <p>Before, I had learned Git and GitHub in another course but in this new course I was able to learn these apps in depth.</p>
        <p>Finally, I will learn about databases with SQL, MongoDB and Mongoose. Previously, I had learned a little bit with SQL Server in school and I
          learned how to create, update and delete elements in SQL Server tables.</p>
